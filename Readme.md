# Redux- Side Effects - Method-1 (Handling Redux Side Effects in Regular React Components)

This project demonstrates/shows an example of how to handle **Redux-side-effects** in **regular react components.** The alternative for this is handling redux-react side effects with **custom action creators** via the use of **Thunks.**

## Running the project

CD into the project directory and run the following command:

```
npm install
```

To use the backend, (and if you have time) you can create your own simple API endpoints and replace the HTTP Requests links on this project with your own. Alternatively, you can quickly get a Firebase real-time-database test-link and use that instead.
